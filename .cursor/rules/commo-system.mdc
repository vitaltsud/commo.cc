# commo.cc — Global Trust Marketplace (System Context)

## 1. Project Vision

**commo.cc** is a global service marketplace (similar to Kabanchik/Thumbtack) connecting clients with service professionals (handymen, electricians, etc.).

- **Core Principle:** "Hard Trust" through mandatory ID verification and immutable client ratings.
- **Monetization:** Tiered subscription model for professionals (no commissions from deals).
- **Communication:** Integrated Google ecosystem (Auth, Google Chat, AI-driven sentiment analysis).

## 2. Technical Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Font:** Inter (primary font; optimize for Latin and Cyrillic).
- **Design:** Ultra-minimalist, high-contrast (White / Graphite `#1A1A1A`), mobile-first, "Zen" UI.
- **Auth:** Google OAuth 2.0 (mandatory for all users).
- **Communication:** Automated creation of Google Chat Spaces for every matched project.
- **Admin Panel:** `adm.commo.cc` — global monitoring and AI insights.

## 3. Core Business Logic ("Engine")

- **Hard ID Verification:** Professionals upload ID/Passport; verification status is a primary trust badge.
- **Immutable Ratings:** Clients have final say; professional ratings cannot be edited or deleted by the provider.
- **Tiered Subscriptions:** Cost depends on:
  1. Service Category (e.g. Light: Cleaning vs Heavy: Construction).
  2. Local Market Index (purchasing power of country/city).
  3. Loyalty Discount: 4.9+ rated professionals get subscription discounts.
- **AI Analytics:** AI monitors Google Chat logs for sentiment, fraud prevention, and strategy suggestions in Admin.

## 4. Navigation & Sitemap

### Public (commo.cc)

- **Header:** Logo, "How it Works", "For Pros", "Sign in with Google".
- **Hero:** Minimal search bar ("What do you need to fix?").
- **Grid:** Category icons (Inter, line-style icons).

### User Dashboard (after login)

- Same minimalist design; add "My Projects", "Messages" (→ Google Chat), "Profile".
- **Client:** Create project, view recommended pros, manage active jobs.
- **Pro:** Lead feed, Subscription management, Reputation stats.

### Admin Panel (adm.commo.cc)

- Sidebar: Users (ID Queue), Global Economy (Pricing), AI Insights (Chat analysis), Scraping Management (Google Maps / Job Boards).

## 5. UI/UX Guidelines

- **Typography:** Inter only; line-height and letter-spacing for "premium utility" feel.
- **Interactions:** `framer-motion` for subtle, fast transitions; no heavy animations.
- **Mobile:** Thumb-friendly; sticky bottom navigation on mobile.
- **Colors:**
  - Background: `#FFFFFF`
  - Main text: `#1A1A1A`
  - Primary accent (buttons, verified badges): `#2563EB` (Electric Blue) or Indigo.

## 6. AI Agent Integration (Marketing)

- Support hooks for AI agents monitoring external platforms (Facebook Groups, Google Maps, Job Boards).
- Store "External Leads" in the database for Admin outreach.
